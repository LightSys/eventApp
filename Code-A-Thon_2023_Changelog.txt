LightSys Code-A-Thon 2023 Changelog
Authors: Chris LaFave, Eli Bolleddu, and Dr. John Hunt.
Dates: March 6th-10th, 2023

Goals:
1. - Update the app for the latest SDK and WorkManager release. The app uses the WorkManager library
to handle checking for updates and notifications, and this library has continued to improve over time.
2. - Fix a bug where event schedule times are sometimes printed incorrectly on the main app activity. For
example, 12:30 might be printed as 1:23 or something like that instead.
3. - Add a setting (coming from the configuration on the server) to allow the event manager to permit
event participants to share the event's QR code with other participants during the time period that the
event is active (there is an event expiry date in the event configuration). The server side is coded in
PHP, and the change there would be adding a database table field and a checkbox in the user interface.

Updates:
1. Update SDK and WorkManager
-build.gradle (:app) now has SDK version of 33 (did not change min SDK, still 21)
-build.gradle (:app) now has 2.8.0 of WorkManager
-The app has been automatically updated to support androidx libraries (instead of some stuff before)
-launchQRScanner now has an onDestroy() method with a try-catch that is necessary for the app running on the new updates

2. Fix HM:M bug
-Remember to update tomorrow Chris

3. Add Share QR feature
-In MainActivity, onLongClick() now checks whether or not a user is allowed to share the QR code
    -If yes:
     promptLongClick() is shown, asking the user to choose between sharing or deleting the event
     If "Share QR" is clicked, the current event's QR is shown
     If "Delete Event" is clicked, the normal delete event window is shown
    -If no:
     The normal delete event window is shown
-It is able to check because a new column was added to the backend, toggling whether or not the users should be allowed to share the QR code
-Creating the QR code image is in the new promptShareQR() method in MainActivity
    -It uses https://github.com/androidmads/QRGenerator
